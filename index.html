                <h2>Major Contributions to Engineering</h2>
                <p>Elijah McCoy played a key role in advancing industrial technology by developing solutions that dramatically improved the performance of steam-powered machines. His most important invention was the automatic lubricator for steam engines, patented in 1872 (National Inventors Hall of Fame, n.d.). Before this, trains and factory machines had to be stopped regularly for manual oiling, which slowed production and increased wear. McCoy's design allowed machines to be oiled while running, greatly improving efficiency and reducing breakdowns.</p>
                
                <p>Over his career, McCoy earned 57 U.S. patents, most of them focused on improving lubrication technology (Eschner, 2017). His device used steam pressure to deliver oil directly to moving parts, preventing overheating and extending the lifespan of machinery (National Inventors Hall of Fame, n.d.). Because of its reliability, McCoy's lubricator was quickly adopted by railroads, steamships, and factories across North America and Europe. His consistent quality even helped popularize the phrase "the Real McCoy," referring to something authentic and dependable.</p>
                
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <strong>Did You Know?</strong> McCoy's lubricators became so well-known for their quality that engineers and buyers would specifically ask for "the real McCoy" to avoid purchasing inferior copies from competitors <a href="#ref3" class="citation">(Sluby, 2004)</a>. This phrase is still used today to mean "the genuine article."

In 1920, at age 77, he established the Elijah McCoy Manufacturing Company in Detroit to produce lubricators bearing his own name <a href="#ref1" class="citation">(National Inventors Hall of Fame, n.d.)</a>.</p>

                <h2>Why Elijah McCoy Should Be Celebrated</h2>
                <p>I chose Elijah McCoy because his life shows how determination and creativity can overcome unfair obstacles. Even though he trained as an engineer in Scotland, racism stopped him from getting an engineering job in the United States. Instead of giving up, he worked on the railroads, where he noticed real problems and used his skills to create solutions that ended up changing industries.</p>
                
                <p>His most famous invention, the automatic lubrication system, helped trains, ships, and factory machines run more safely and efficiently. Before this, engines had to stop often so workers could oil them by hand, which was slow, expensive, and risky. McCoy’s system allowed engines to lubricate themselves while running, saving time, money, and lives, and making a big difference in industrial growth.</p>
                
                <p>McCoy is important to celebrate because he held more patents than any other Black inventor of his time and broke barriers in engineering. His work showed that African Americans could be just as innovative as anyone else. Today, his story inspires people and reminds us that having different perspectives in science and technology leads to better ideas and progress.</p>
